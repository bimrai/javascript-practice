// Well well well... I have a fever... And I have not been studying the past day or two so I figured lets at least make this.

let temp = 40

if(temp > 37.3) {
    console.log("You have a fever");
} else if (temp < 37.3) {
   console.log("You are healthy");
}

const sick = true;

if(sick) {
    console.log("Take paracetamol 1000mg every 6 hours");
} else {
    console.log("You are healthy");
}

let daysOfFever = 4

if (daysOfFever >= 3) {
    console.log("Seek medical attention!")
} else {
    console.log("Get good rest and stay hydrated.")
}
